# Goal App Project
This is my university project - Goal App! It`s main purpose its to organise the user`s goals or tasks easily. It has
plain and simple design which could be found appealing by many. The features are not complex, the user can enter his/hers tasks
and if needed set a notification which works as a reminder for the task. After adding the goal, the user could delete it in case
there is a mistake or delete it after completion just by pressing on it. If there is a scheduled notification and the user complete
the task before the appointed time in future and he has cleared the task from the list, he wont recevice any reminders(since the task is complete and there is no need).

The app is developed using React Native and Expo Go. This makes it compatible with both Android and IOS systems. No data is collected(because this version of the app 
is ran locally and its not deployed in any stores for free download) and the notifications are local as well. This leaves room for further improvement in future versions of the app.
The UI is intuitive and written in Bulgarian laungage. The colors are well coordinated and they dont bother the user. The transition between the main screen which contains the tasks/goals
and the screen for appointing new goals is made using a React Native element called Modal. This makes the movement smooth. And since the task entering screen is defined like that, the user
could enter multiple goals one after an other without the need of going back and forward between the screens.
