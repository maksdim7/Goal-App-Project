🎯 Goal App Project

Welcome to Goal App — my university project designed to help users stay productive and organized! 💪✨

🧩 Overview

The Goal App makes it simple and efficient to manage your personal goals and daily tasks. With its clean and minimalistic design, users can enjoy an experience that feels light, intuitive, and distraction-free.

🚀 Main Features

✅ Add Tasks & Goals — Quickly create new goals or tasks.

🔔 Smart Notifications — Set reminders to keep yourself on track.

❌ Easy Deletion — Remove completed tasks or fix mistakes with just one tap.

🕒 Smart Reminder Handling — If you complete and delete a task before its scheduled reminder, the app automatically cancels the notification — because you’ve already done it! 🙌

⚙️ Technical Details

The app is built using React Native and Expo Go, ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS devices 📱.
All data and notifications are handled locally, so no personal information is collected. This setup makes it perfect for future enhancements like cloud sync or public release. 🌐

🖌️ User Interface

The UI is intuitive, simple, and presented in Bulgarian 🇧🇬.
Colors are carefully coordinated for a pleasant visual experience that doesn’t strain the eyes.
Transitions between the main screen (with your goals) and the goal creation screen use a React Native Modal, ensuring smooth and seamless navigation.
Thanks to this setup, users can add multiple goals one after another without unnecessary back-and-forth — boosting efficiency and flow. 🚀

💡 Future Improvements

This local version is just the beginning — future updates could include:

☁️ Cloud data storage

📅 Calendar integration

🧠 Smarter task analytics
